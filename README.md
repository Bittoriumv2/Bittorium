Bittorium Core integration repository
=====================================


Bittorium is an open source crypto-currency focused on fast private transactions using the Zerocoin protocol, with low transaction fees & environmental footprint.  It utilizes the first ever anonymous proof of stake protocol, called zPoS, combined with regular PoS and masternodes for securing its network. zPoS incentivises using the privacy features available in Bittorium by granting a higher block reward for zPoS over regular PoS and masternodes. In practice Bittorium has between 4 to 10 times higher use of it's privacy features in comparison to other coins that combine public and private transactions. This is thanks to innovations like zPoS and integrating the Zerocoin protocol into light/mobile wallets, allowing for a complete and lightweight privacy protocol that can be used on the go. 
The goal of Bittorium is to achieve a decentralized sustainable crypto currency with near instant full-time private transactions, fair governance and community intelligence.
- Anonymized transactions & consensus using the [_Zerocoin Protocol_][zPoS]
- light/mobile wallet privacy using the [Zerocoin Light Node Protocol](coming soon)
- Fast transactions featuring guaranteed zero confirmation transactions.
- Decentralized blockchain voting utilizing Masternode technology.
- Based on PIVX codebase.
